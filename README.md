# EPE 043 Introduction Data_Analytics for Smart Energy Systems
## Objective
The aims of this module are to:
Introduce the main principles of diagnostic, predictive and operational analytics with relevance to the energy sector.
Cover the key theoretical principles under-pinning big data analytics
Utilise case studies to explore how stakeholders such as electricity system operators, utilities and aggregators can use data analytics to create clean, affordable, and flexible energy systems.
##

* Applied case studies


## Chapter 2: Descriptive Statistics
Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organisation, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.
Summary statistics are used to summarise a set of observations to communicate the largest amount of information as simply as possible.
A descriptive statistic (in the count noun sense) is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarises features from a collection of information, while descriptive statistics (in the mass noun sense) is the process of using and analysing those statistics.

## Chapter 4: Data Visualisation 
One of the most valuable exercises when exploring new datasets is plotting the data somehow. Data visualisation is the graphical representation of information and data. Using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualisation tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.
The benefits of data visualisation include:
* Improved comprehension: Visuals make complex data easier to understand.
* Quick insights: Patterns and trends become apparent quickly.
*	Better communication: Visuals can convey information more effectively than text alone.
*	Enhanced decision-making: Clear visuals can support better analysis and informed decisions.
