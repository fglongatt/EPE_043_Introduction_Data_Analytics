## Chapter 2: Descriptive Statistics
Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organisation, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.
Summary statistics are used to summarise a set of observations to communicate the largest amount of information as simply as possible.
A descriptive statistic (in the count noun sense) is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarises features from a collection of information, while descriptive statistics (in the mass noun sense) is the process of using and analysing those statistics.
