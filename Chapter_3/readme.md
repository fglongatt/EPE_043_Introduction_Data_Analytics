Chapter 3: Probability Function
In statistics, a population is defined as the complete set of all possible observations or measurements that can be made about a specific characteristic within a group or category. It includes every single item or individual that fits the criteria of interest. A sample is a subset of individuals, items, or data points selected from a larger population. The purpose of using a sample is to gather information and make inferences about the entire population without examining every single member of that population. The population is the entire set or group to conclude about, whereas the sample is the specific group from which data is collected.
